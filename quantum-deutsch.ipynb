    "<h4>So, what is Quantum Computing?</h4>\n",
    "<p>Quantum computing is an area in computing in which quantum physics is utilised in order to solve complex computational problems. The word quantum refers to the smallest physical unit. Similar to classical computing which solves problems using bits, a quantum computer solves its problems by processing the state of what are know as 'Qubits' or 'Quantum Bits'. Unlike a bit, which can only be in a state of 1 or 0, a qubit is able to be 1, 0 or anywhere inbetween. While classical computers are perfect for day to day tasks, they lack the speed and computing power to solves the most complex of problems it is in this scenario where quantum computers come into their own. Yes, you can add more transistors to a classical computer to increase its computational power however, this will only ever increase its power linearly. When more qubits are added to a quantum computer the computational power increases exponentially thus making them perfect for the most complex of problems.</p>\n",

    "<h3>Superposition</h3>\n",
    "<p>Superposition refers to the state in which a qubit can be found in. Unlike a bit, which can only be found in a state of 1 or 0, a qubit has the ability to be found in a state of 1, 0 or anywhere in-between. The capability of this results in the quantum computers power as the qubits can take all computational paths simultaneously thus speeding up the process of solving the problem at hand.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Entanglement</h3>\n",
    "<p>Entanglement is the idea of two qubits invading eachothers space and becoming 'entangled'. When this happens they form a single system and become correlated. The idea of entanglement helps the quantum computer by increasing it computational power when solving complex problems as one qubit helps to predict the details of the entangled qubits.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Interference</h3>\n",
    "<p>Interference is allso known as bias. This is when the position of the qubit is altered towards the desired output. Interference is allow to happen due to the superposition of a qubit.</p>\n",

    "<p>David Deutsch is considered to be the first to show how different a quantum computer computes a problem from a classical computer. The algorithm he used to show this came to be know as 'Deutsch's Algorithm'.</p>\n",
    "<h4>Defining the problem</h4>\n",
    "<p>f is a that takes in 0 or 1 as an input and returns 0 or 1 as an output. The function is said to be either a balanced function or a constant function. A function is said to be balanced when it returns 0 as the output 50% of the time and 1 as the output for the other 50% of inputs. A function is said to be constant when it gives out the same output (1 or 0) forr every input it is given.</p>\n",

    "<p>In order to decide the function type, we must check the output twice. However, when the number of input bits(n) increases the workload grows exponentially. The functions output has to be check 2^n-1 +1 times in order to decide its function type.</p>\n",
